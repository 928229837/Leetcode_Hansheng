Hello Dr. Gray,

Rather than take one of the presented options, we would like to make an app that
visualizes health data. It will show how different metrics (such as caloric
intake or frequency of exercise) vary over time, and even find interesting
correlations between different metrics. One of the ways we want to challenge
ourselves is by being able to fetch data from multiple sources. Our app will
support at least two, but probably three, of the following sources: Apple
Healthkit, Google Fit, Fitbit, and Microsoft HealthVault.

Since our team has very little experience with mobile app development, we'd like
to make this into a desktop application instead of an Android app.

We are interested in hearing any feedback or suggestions you might have
regarding our proposed project. In particular, do you think a desktop app would
be a good idea given the content of CS 495? For example, if there will be a
final exam that covers Android knowledge, then we obviously should make this
into an Android app instead.
