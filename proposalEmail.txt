Hello Dr. Gray,

For our project we were thinking of developing an app that translates the large
XML file that the apple watch exports into meaningful information that is
displayed in a GUI and is easily manipulated.

As it stands, Apple provides no first party support for this. There is no
desktop app to make sense of this information and it is all lumped together into
one XML file. This file can be hundreds of thousands of lines long as it spans
the lifetime of the device.  Likewise, viewing this information on an Android
device isn't very easy, and a less hacky software solution could be
useful. (Currently, it requires sim cards to be swapped between a viable paired
iPhone and Android phone.)

A further direction we would be interested in pursuing would be taking exported
information from various wearable devices alongside the apple watch, translating
the information into a common format, then displaying it in a meaningful way and
providing the user an easier means by which to manipulate that information.

Since our team has very little experience with mobile app development, we'd like
to make this into a desktop application instead of an Android app. Would that be
alright with you, Dr. Gray? We're also interested in hearing any feedback or
suggestions you might have regarding our proposed project.
