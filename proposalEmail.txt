Hello Dr. Gray,

Rather than take one of the presented options, we would like to make an app that
visualizes health data. It will show how different metrics (such as caloric
intake or frequency of exercise) vary over time, and even find interesting
correlations between different metrics. One of the ways we want to challenge
ourselves is by being able to fetch data multiple sources. Our app will support
at least two, but probably three, of the following sources: Apple Healthkit,
Google Fit, Fitbit, and Microsoft HealthVault.

Since our team has very little experience with mobile app development, we'd like
to make this into a desktop application instead of an Android app. Would that be
alright with you, Dr. Gray? We're also interested in hearing any feedback or
suggestions you might have regarding our proposed project.
